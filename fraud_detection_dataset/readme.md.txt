Building a Fraud Detection Model for Credit Card Transactions 💳🔍

In today’s world of digital transactions, detecting fraudulent activities is a critical task for safeguarding financial systems. I recently completed a project where I built a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Python and a real-world dataset. Here's what I accomplished:

📊 Dataset Highlights: #!/bin/bash kaggle datasets download kartik2112/fraud-detection

The dataset included over 1 million credit card transactions, labeled as legitimate or fraudulent. Key features analyzed: transaction amount, merchant details, geolocation data, and customer demographics. 🛠️ Techniques & Algorithms Used:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and engineered features like distance between user and merchant (using the Haversine formula), one-hot encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features. Algorithms: Experimented with Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. Handling Class Imbalance: Utilized SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance fraudulent and legitimate transaction classes. 📈 Visualizations:

Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve to evaluate model performance. Feature Importance to understand which features were most predictive of fraud. Distribution of predicted probabilities for fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions. 🎯 Results:

Achieved high ROC AUC scores with the Random Forest model, showcasing its effectiveness in identifying fraud with minimal false positives. 💡 Takeaways:

The project underscored the importance of feature engineering and handling class imbalances in fraud detection. Advanced visualizations provided meaningful insights into model performance and feature importance. 👉 Next Steps: Incorporating real-time fraud detection strategies and optimizing model performance for deployment.

This project not only strengthened my skills in machine learning and data visualization, but it also reaffirmed how impactful technology can be in tackling real-world challenges.
